        "description": "The Nike Air Huarache released in 1991 as a cutting-edge running shoe that helped revolutionize the fit and feel of performance athletic footwear as we know it today. Designed by the one and only Tinker Hatfield, famous for his many iconic Air Jordan and Nike sneakers including the original Air Max running shoe, the Air Huarache has gone on to become a retro sneaker staple in the modern age — just like many of his designs. The Nike Air Huarache was groundbreaking when it released because of the technology it introduced to the world: the Huarache construction. Inspired by the neoprene booties of water-skis after he noticed how well they conformed to the foot and ankle area, Hatfield translated the foot-hugging concept to athletic footwear, and the Huarache was born. Technical and minimal at the same time, the Air Huarache running shoe is characterized by the comfortable neoprene inner bootie that is strategically surrounded with synthetic overlays and a rubber heel cage to offer support only where it is needed. The upper sits on top of a Phylon™ foam midsole with encapsulated Air-Sole® units to cushion every stride, while a classic Nike waffle rubber outsole sits below to offer ideal grip."
