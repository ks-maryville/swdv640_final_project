Assignment Details

Week 5: 

Building on what you've already created for your final project website, add a responsive HTML grid layout that is usable across all device viewport sizes including phone, tablet, and desktop.

You may utilize grid systems such as Bootstrap or create your own.  Make sure that the CSS media queries you use correctly target the viewports and that your styles render as expected.  In addition, make sure to include at least a logo image into your interface and include the correct ARIA attribute for this image(s).

Week 6:
Add specific color scheme styling to the existing HTML layout of your final project website, utilizing a separate LESS stylesheet.

Include color variables, nested styling, and mixins into your LESS stylesheet that the various HTML elements in your page will use. 

Week 7:
Include the Mustache JS framework into your final project interface.

Abstraction of data is a way to separate our content from the markup and styling.  Place your content into JavaScript variables and utilize the proper Mustache JS code in your HTML to populate the page.

Week 8:
In our final week, we will be adding the additional pages from your earlier storyboard assignment to your interface websites.  Please add content to these new pages and make sure the site is fully functional and error free.   You should have at least five web pages with functional content.
